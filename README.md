# Jobsity - Challenge

This is a WordPress directory for the Jobsity Challenge.

## Installation

I've used Local by Flywheel to set up my localhost. In this directory, I removed the default WordPress folders wp-admin and wp-includes.

1 - Install Local by Flywheel

2 - Create a local site with the following configuration:

```bash
Site domain: jobsite.local
Web server: nginx
Php version: 8.1.23
Database: MySQL 8.0.1.6
Wordpress version: 6.5.3
```
3 - Access the GitHub repository

```bash
https://github.com/leddemotta/jobsity-challenge 
```

4 - Download the wp-content folder from the repository.

5 - Copy the wp-content folder into your local project.

6 - Download and extract the a.zip file.

7 - Extract the local.sql.gz file.

8 - Upload the local.sql file into your Local by Flywheel Adminer database.

Done!
